# Flutter Mapbox GL

> **Please note that this project is community driven and is not an official Mapbox product.** We welcome [feedback](https://github.com/tobrun/flutter-mapbox-gl/issues) and contributions.

This Flutter plugin allows to show embedded interactive and customizable vector maps inside a Flutter widget. For the Android and iOS integration, we use [mapbox-gl-native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native). For web, we rely on [mapbox-gl-js](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js). This project only supports a subset of the API exposed by these libraries.

## Running the example app

- Install [Flutter](https://flutter.io/get-started/) and validate its installation with `flutter doctor`
- Clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:mapbox/flutter-mapbox-gl.git`
- Add a Mapbox access token to the example app (see next section)
- Connect a mobile device or start an emulator, simulator or chrome
- Locate the id of a the device with `flutter devices`
- Run the app with `cd flutter_mapbox/example && flutter packages get && flutter run -d {device_id}``

### Adding a Mapbox Access Token

This project uses Mapbox vector tiles, which requires a Mapbox account and a Mapbox access token. Obtain a free access token on [your Mapbox account page](https://www.mapbox.com/account/access-tokens/).
> **Even if you do not use Mapbox vector tiles but vector tiles from a different source (like self-hosted tiles) with this plugin, you will need to specify any non-empty string as Access Token as explained below!**

##### Android

Add Mapbox access token configuration in the application manifest `example/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest ...
  <application ...
    <meta-data android:name="com.mapbox.token" android:value="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" />
```

##### iOS

Add Mapbox access token configuration to the application Info.plist `example/ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>io.flutter.embedded_views_preview</key>
<true/>
<key>MGLMapboxAccessToken</key>
<string>YOUR_TOKEN_HERE</string>
```

##### Web

Add Mapbox access token configuration to index.html `example/web/index.html`:

```html
<body>
  ...
  <script>
    mapboxgl.accessToken = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE';
  </script>
</body>
```

## Using the SDK in your project

This project is available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/mapbox_gl), follow the [instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages#adding-a-package-dependency-to-an-app) to integrate a package into your flutter application. For platform specific integration, use the flutter application under the example folder as reference.

## Offline Sideloading

Support for offline maps is available by *"side loading"* the required map tiles and including them in your `assets` folder.

* Create your tiles package by following the guide available [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/overview/offline/).

* Place the tiles.db file generated in step one in your assets directory and add a reference to it in your `pubspec.yml` file.

```
   assets:
     - assets/cache.db
```

* Call `installOfflineMapTiles` when your application starts to copy your tiles into the location where Mapbox can access them.  **NOTE:** This method should be called **before** the Map widget is loaded to prevent collisions when copying the files into place.
 
```
    try {
      await installOfflineMapTiles(join("assets", "cache.db"));
    } catch (err) {
      print(err);
    }
```

## Location features

To enable location features in an iOS application:

If you access your users' location, you should also add the following key to your Info.plist to explain why you need access to their location data:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>[Your explanation here]</string>
```

Mapbox [recommends](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/first-steps-ios-sdk/#display-the-users-location) the explanation "Shows your location on the map and helps improve the map".
