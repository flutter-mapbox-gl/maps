# Flutter Mapbox GL Native

> **Please note that this project is experimental and is not officially supported.** We welcome [feedback](https://github.com/tobrun/flutter-mapbox-gl/issues) and contributions.

This Flutter plugin for [mapbox-gl-native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native) enables
embedded interactive and customizable vector maps inside of a Flutter widget. This project plugin is in early development stage. Only Android is supported for now.
the plugin relies on Flutter's new mechanism for embedding Android and iOS views.

## Getting Started

### Android

Following examples use Mapbox vector tiles, which require a Mapbox account and a Mapbox access token. Obtain a free access token on [your Mapbox account page](https://www.mapbox.com/account/access-tokens/). After you get the key, place it in project's Android directory:
- Add your access token to `$project_dir/example/android/app/src/values/developer-config.xml`

#### Demo app

- Install [Flutter](https://flutter.io/get-started/) and validate its installation with `flutter doctor`
- Clone this repository with `git clone git@github.com:mapbox/flutter-mapbox-gl.git`
- Run the app with `cd flutter_mapbox/example && flutter run`

#### New project

- Create new Flutter project in your IDE or via terminal
- Add `mapbox_gl: ^0.0.1` dependency to `pubspec.yaml` file and [get the package](https://flutter.io/using-packages/#adding-a-package-dependency-to-an-app)
- Add Mapbox read token value in the application manifest `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest ...
  <application ...
    <meta-data android:name="com.mapbox.token" android:value="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" />
```

- Import Mapbox widgets and add them to your widget tree
```
import 'package:mapbox_gl/mapbox_gl.dart';
```
