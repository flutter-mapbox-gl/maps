/// A Feature object has a member with the name "geometry". The value of the geometry member SHALL be
/// either a Geometry object or, in the case that the Feature is unlocated, a JSON null value.
/// <p>
/// A Feature object has a member with the name "properties". The value of the properties member is
/// an object (any JSON object or a JSON null value).
/// <p>
/// If a Feature has a commonly used identifier, that identifier SHOULD be included as a member of
/// the Feature object through the {@link #id()} method, and the value of this member is either a
/// JSON string or number.
