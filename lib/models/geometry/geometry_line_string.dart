/// A linestring represents two or more geographic points that share a relationship and is one of the
/// seven geometries found in the GeoJson spec.
/// <p>
/// This adheres to the RFC 7946 internet standard when serialized into JSON. When deserialized, this
/// class becomes an immutable object which should be initiated using its static factory methods.
/// </p><p>
/// The list of points must be equal to or greater than 2. A LineString has non-zero length and
/// zero area. It may approximate a curve and need not be straight. Unlike a LinearRing, a LineString
/// is not closed.
/// </p><p>
/// When representing a LineString that crosses the antimeridian, interoperability is improved by
/// modifying their geometry. Any geometry that crosses the antimeridian SHOULD be represented by
/// cutting it in two such that neither part's representation crosses the antimeridian.
/// </p><p>
/// For example, a line extending from 45 degrees N, 170 degrees E across the antimeridian to 45
/// degrees N, 170 degrees W should be cut in two and represented as a MultiLineString.
